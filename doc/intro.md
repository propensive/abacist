Many units of measurement in use today have not yet been decimalized, and work
in non-decimal and mixed bases. Arithmetic using these units can be convoluted,
requiring either conversion or error-prone carrying. _Abacist_ builds upon the
representations of physical quantities provided by
[Quantitative](https://github.com/propensive/quantitative/) to support compound
units in mixed bases.
