- allows arbitrary constructions of cascading units of the same dimension, such as (miles, yards, feet and inches)
- provides addition, subtraction and scalar multiplication operations on those units
- allows conversion to and from decimal `Quantity` values
- unit types are opaque aliases of `Long` for performance
